## 🎯 What I Do

I transform ideas into intelligent systems. My work spans three powerful domains:

### 🤖 Machine Learning
Building predictive models and data-driven solutions using scikit-learn, pandas, and TensorFlow. Clustering, classification, and regression on real datasets.

### ⚙️ Workflow Automation  
Designing n8n workflows that handle 200+ data points daily. Built a feedback management system currently in use at my college—proving automation works.

### 🧠 AI Agents & Advanced Systems
Learning to build intelligent agents that think, decide, and automate complex processes. Completed IIT Jammu's AI Agents Winter School.

🏆 My Best Work
Student Feedback Automation System
View on GitHub

An n8n workflow processing feedback from 500+ students. Automatically filters low ratings, sends admin alerts, captures student confirmations, and logs everything to Google Sheets.

Real Impact: Running in production at my college

Processing: 200+ feedback entries with zero manual intervention

Time Saved: ~15 hours/semester of manual sorting

✨ The Philosophy
<div align="center">
"Build systems that think. Automate processes that don't. Learn continuously."

From manual processes to intelligent workflows.
From static models to adaptive AI agents.
From learning to mastery through discipline.

Code today. Lead tomorrow.
